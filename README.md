# syscall monitoring

This workspace contains an eBPF program `syscall_monitoring.c` and a libbpf-based user program `user_monitor.c` to load it and periodically flush per-PID, per-syscall statistics to stdout.

What it does
- Tracks per-PID, per-syscall count, sum latency, max latency, and bytes for common I/O syscalls (sendmsg/sendto/recvmsg/recvfrom/read/readv/write/writev).
- Flushes and prints stats every 10 seconds (configurable).
- Supports optional whitelisting of task command names (comm) via `-c/--comm`.
- Self-excludes the monitoring process so it does not skew results.
- Uses BPF CO-RE (Compile Once â€“ Run Everywhere) by including a generated `vmlinux.h` for robust tracepoint field layout (no hand-maintained struct definitions).

Build
1. Install dependencies: libbpf, bpftool, clang, pkg-config, and kernel headers.

On Debian/Ubuntu you can try:

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y clang llvm libbpf-dev libbpfcc-dev bpftool build-essential pkg-config linux-headers-$(uname -r)
```

2. Build (automatically generates `vmlinux.h` for CO-RE):

```bash
make
```

This creates `syscall_monitoring.bpf.o`, generates `syscall_monitoring.skel.h`, and builds the `user_monitor` binary.

Run

Run as root (required to load BPF programs):

```bash
sudo ./user_monitor
```

Specify a flush interval (seconds):

```bash
sudo ./user_monitor -i 5
```

Whitelist only specific process comm names (task names) using one or more `-c/--comm` flags. When any are supplied, only syscalls from tasks whose `comm` exactly matches a provided name (truncated to 15 chars like the kernel) are monitored. Example monitoring only `nginx` and `redis-server`:

```bash
sudo ./user_monitor -c nginx -c redis-server
```

Combine with interval:

```bash
sudo ./user_monitor -i 2 -c bash -c sshd
```

If no `-c/--comm` options are given, all processes are monitored (except the monitor itself).

Output
Every interval the program prints lines like:

PID=1234 comm=nginx call=write count=42 avg_ms=0.123 max_ms=0.456 bytes=65536

Notes
- The user program contains a small syscall name map for common syscalls. You can extend `syscall_name()` with additional names or integrate a full syscall table.
- If bpftool is not available, you can manually place a suitable `vmlinux.h` (matching your kernel) into the workspace; the Makefile will otherwise attempt to produce one from `/sys/kernel/btf/vmlinux`.
- The monitor writes its own PID into a BPF map so the eBPF program ignores events from the monitor process (prevents self-observation). Remove the `monitor_pid_map` update for different behavior.
- Command filtering: the eBPF side keeps a hash map of allowed `comm` strings (up to 64 entries). A second array map holds a single enable flag. If filtering is enabled and a task's `comm` is not present, the event is skipped early. Overhead is minimal when filtering is off (one map lookup for the flag, then proceed).
- CO-RE eliminates the need to manually maintain tracepoint struct layouts; field offsets are resolved via BTF at load time, making the program more portable across kernel versions.
